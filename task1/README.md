## Machine Learning Classification of Dates

### Introduction

This project explores the classification of different date varieties (Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi, and Sagai) using Machine Learning.

### Objective

The main objective was to develop Machine Learning models that could accurately classify types of date fruit based on their external appearance characteristics, such as color, length, diameter, and shape.

### Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition:**
- Collected 898 images of 7 types of dates.
- Extracted 34 features (morphological, shape, and color) from the images.

2. **Model Development:**
- Implemented various Machine Learning algorithms (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, etc.).
- Optimized the models for better performance.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluated the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the model with the best performance.

### Results

- Achieved classification accuracy exceeding 90% for the best models.
- Identified the most relevant attributes for classification.

### Conclusion

The application of Machine Learning proved effective in classifying dates based on their external appearance characteristics.
