### Task 2 - Competition Dataset Task

This practical work involves developing Machine Learning models to predict the amount of electrical energy generated by solar panels and injected into the power grid. The dataset used contains data related to the energy production of solar panels in the city of Braga (between September 2021 and April 2023).

- Work with the dataset available at [https://www.kaggle.com/c/daasbstp2023](https://www.kaggle.com/c/daasbstp2023)
- Sign up for the competition and form teams
- Explore, analyze, and prepare the competition dataset.
- Design and optimize Machine Learning models for the competition dataset.
- Submit the results on the Kaggle platform (limited to 3 valid submissions per day).
- Obtain and critically analyze the results.
- Interpret the results and define their usefulness in the context of the problem.
- Determine and explain the most relevant results.
